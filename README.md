![image](https://github.com/SAIPRONE/sensor_readings_24/assets/95390348/572e831e-5f5a-4864-8f52-88066d3e523f)
This repository contains Python scripts that utilize various machine learning models to process and analyze sensor data.

## üìå Overview

These scripts are designed to load, preprocess, and apply machine learning models to the dataset from sensor readings. Three distinct approaches have been used: logistic regression, neural networks using TensorFlow, and a modified neural network.

## üöÄ Scripts Description

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Logistic Regression for Sensor Data

- **Libraries Used**:
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
  - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
  - [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
  
- **Functionality**:
  - Loads and preprocesses the data using Pandas and scikit-learn.
  - Builds and evaluates a logistic regression model.
  - Displays a confusion matrix of the results using Seaborn.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Neural Network using TensorFlow

- **Libraries Used**:
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
  - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
  - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
  
- **Functionality**:
  - Loads and preprocesses the data.
  - Builds and trains a neural network model using TensorFlow.
  - Evaluates and prints the model's accuracy on training and test data.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Modified Neural Network

- **Libraries Used**:
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
  - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
  - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
  
- **Functionality**:
  - Similar functionality to the second script but with a slight variation in the neural network architecture.
